# AccesibilityAndSEO

##Discription
This site is a demonstration of my ability to clean up code in HTML and CSS as well as my ability to add accessibility and search engine optimization to code.

##Installation
There is no installation necessary for this code. All that is needed to run it is a web browser.

##Usage
Since this is a demonstration of the main page of a website, the links are non-functional. The site is for viewing purposes only.

##Credits
The original code for this HTML was provided by the Trilogy for their full stack coding bootcamp at the University of Richmond.

All modifications for accessibility, search engine optimization, and code consolidation and cleanup were done by Trenton Schneider. You can find his work on GitHub [here] (https://github.com/TrentSchneider)
